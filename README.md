[![CD: Build and Deploy API to GKE](https://github.com/likhity/asu-course-tracker/actions/workflows/cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/likhity/asu-course-tracker/actions/workflows/cd.yml)
# ASU Course Tracker

A way to track any course at ASU and get a text message sent to you whenever the number of seats for a course changes.

Now built as a React Native app with a .NET Core backend and a PostgreSQL database.

Deployment with Docker containers on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine), using AWS RDS (Postgres) and AWS ECR for image storage. CI/CD pipeline built with GitHub Actions for automated builds, tests, and deployments.

Originally developed as a monolithic web app with the MVC approach using Node.js, Express.js, EJS for server-side rendering, and MongoDB, with authentication using JSON Web Tokens and texting to student users with Twilio API.

Will be available for download soon.

## Story

I really wanted a good teacher for my CSE310: Data Structures and Algorithms course at ASU because it is a very important course.

I had a positive experience with professor Feng in the past, so I wanted to take her. However, the seats for all of her classes were filled.

I emailed my advisor asking for an override but was told that overrides are not given for full classes. My advisor told me to just check often in case any student drops from the course because students drop all the time leading up to the semester.

I did just that. But I encountered a problem.

I noticed that it is impossible to check often enough so that I don't miss it if a seat opens.

I looked online and found [ASUClassFinder](https://www.asuclassfinder.com/), which does the exact same thing as what I've created here: sends you a text message whenever the number of seats for a course changes. However, that website's service is not free. Which I found to be very annoying.

I was so angry that I wanted to make a free version that all students can use. So I spent a few weeks building this.

And I decided to title it ASU Course Tracker (I won the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for "Most Original Title").

I made a full website that students can use just like ASUClassFinder.

I did the whole shebang:

- I set up an entire server with Node.js and Express
- Started using MongoDB with it to store all the user data
- Setup basic authentication with JSON Web Tokens
- Figured out how to make a request to ASU to get all course data
- Spent way too long on the CSS for the views

Users can sign up and login,

add courses that they want to track,

manage their account,

basically the entire thing.

I finally started working on the text messaging, the main functionality of the app.

I decided to use Twilio because it's so easy to use. I set up a function `checkForUpdatesAndSendMessages()` that runs every 10 minutes on the server that goes through all the courses stored in the database, makes a request to ASU for information on that course, and if the number of seats have changed from what was previously stored in the database, it sends a text message to all users that are tracking that course to their phone numbers.

And then it finally clicked why making this service free would be impossible. I needed to pay 10 or 20 cents for every text that I sent.

I had a trial balance of $15.50 so I just started using it and didn't worry about how I am gonna fund this thing. By the end of development I had around $14 in my twilio account.

The project was essentially finished, so I had to figure out how to deploy this thing to the world and make it free for students to use.

If I actually deployed this website right now, my remaining trial balance of $14.18 on Twilio will probably quickly run out after hundreds of students sign up and start recieving text messages. If I hit the 512MB limit on the free tier cluster on MongoDB that I'm using for this then the app would no longer function

I'm also in my finals week so continuing this thing would probably tank my grades and I have no interest in doing this anymore.

So I gave up on this ~~essentially useless~~ project and decided to just put it on GitHub.

I was never able to get the teacher that I originally wanted for CSE310.

And I lived ~~happily~~ ever after. The End.

## Conclusion

I plan to make an app that solves this entire problem of not being able to send text messages because I don't have money. Students will just recieve a push notification whenever the number of seats changes. That will have to wait for another day when I actually know how to build an app using something like React Native or Flutter.

Maybe I will write some documentation or something so that a student can clone this project and setup their own Twilio and MongoDB and have it run on their machine and have it text their number whenever the seats for each of the classes that they want changes.
